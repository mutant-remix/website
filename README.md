The is the site for the Mutant Remix emoji pack. You can view the site live at [mutant.revolt.chat](https://mutant.revolt.chat).

This site is built with the static site generator [Adduce](https://adduce.vale.rocks) and any questions regarding this site should be directed to [Vale](https://vale.rocks/contact).

## Building

To build the site, you need to ensure you have Adduce installed. Then run `gen.sh` from the repository's root with `sh gen.sh`. The `gen.sh` file will need editing whenever adding new pages to the site. It will output the site to the `docs/` folder for easy publication using Github Pages.
